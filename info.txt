Perched over 2000m high, on the top of the Andes, lies the Lost city of Machu Picchu.
Over 200 buildings exquisitely cut and crafted with stone make up this city.
The variety of these buildings ranges from homes to temples. 
Each building is fed by a channel of fountains and waterways.
This baffling series of structures was found in 1911.
