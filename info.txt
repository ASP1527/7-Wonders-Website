Located in China, this wonder has almost been around for 2,700 years.
This wall was initially built as several different walls protecting different provinces of China from nomadic invadors.
Qin Shi Huang, also called the First Emperor, united China by uniting all of the existing walls into one.
Each emperor after then focused on strengthening the wall.
From the Ming dynasty onward, the wall was fortified with watchtowers & platforms.
The wall itself measures 4,000km long (2,500 miles).
In China, the wall is called Wann Li Channg-Châ€™ng. That means Long Wall of 10,000 Li. A li equals 0.3 of a mile.
It has a width spanning from 6.5m at the base to 5m at the top.
After Chinese rule was extended to Mongolia, the wall itself lost it's importance as a defence and rather became a symbol of culture.
Only 8.2 percent of the wall is in good condition.
