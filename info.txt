This wonder is located in the heart of the Mayan empire in Mexico.
Chichen Itza contains pyramids, temples & other sophisticated, sacred, stone structures.
Consisting of 365 steps, this wonderful Mayan masterpiece is a representation of each day of the year. Each of the 4 sides of this pyramid contains 91 steps followed by one dominant step, the top platform, which makes the 365th.
The significance of these steps comes from the devising of the yearly calendar which was one of the feats accomplished by Maya science.
During both the spring & autumn equinoxes, a shadow of a serpent appears that joins to a stome serpent head at the base.
Located near the site lie wells. These wells have a sacraficial value to the Mayas since they were used to sacrifice young women for their rain God of which they believed to live in the well.
Interestingly, hosted at the site is a ball court. The aim of this was to hit a ball through stone hoops on the wall. Losers were sadly executed.
